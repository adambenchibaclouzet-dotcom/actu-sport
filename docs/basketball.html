          <strong>SAN ANTONIO</strong> - In an amazing week, the San Antonio Spurs won three games against the Oklahoma City Thunder. They beat the same team three times in just seven days. This is a rare and very impressive feat in the NBA. This perfect week shows the Spurs were the much better team.

        </p>

        <p>
          After the first win, the Spurs played with more and more confidence. They proved the wins were not just luck. Wembanyama was the best player every night, dominating on both sides of the court. But other important players like Devin Vassell and Jeremy Sochan also made big plays in all three games, showing this was a true team effort.
